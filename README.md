# RoboticPerceptionSystem

The aim of this project is to create a prototype for robotic depth perception for human avoidance. The task will be to find the distance between the wall or other obstacles and humans using an image from depth camera mounted on a robot. The darker the pixel the closer the object. Black corresponds to 0 meters; and white corresponds to 5 meters or more.
